This repo contains a python script for a console app that allows the user to manage a list of holidays and save the final list in a json file called ```all-holidays.json```. The app starts with a list of holidays scraped from https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us and has the option to display the weather for a particular day.

To display the weather, the user must request an API key from https://api.openweathermap.org

[plan.png](https://github.com/baylessshannon/holiday-manager/plan.png) refers to my flowchart plan in thinking through how the program will run

[holiday-manager.py](https://github.com/baylessshannon/holiday-manager/blob/master/holiday-manager.py) is my main python file

[holidays.json](https://github.com/baylessshannon/holiday-manager/blob/master/holidays.json) is the list of initial holidays
